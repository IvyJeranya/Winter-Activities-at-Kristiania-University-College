This project is a two-page website designed to showcase winter activities for students at Kristiania University College. The first page serves as a landing page that provides an introduction to the activities, the benefits of participation, testimonials from students, and a registration form. It encourages students to join winter sports and activities while fostering a sense of community.

The second page dives deeper into specific activities, offering detailed information on skiing, snowboarding, slalom, and the popular Ski Party. The page also features a quiz where students can participate for a chance to win exciting prizes, as well as a gallery showcasing images of the winter activities.

This project demonstrates my ability to create a dynamic, interactive site with multiple sections, navigation links, and forms, all designed to engage users and provide essential information in an attractive and user-friendly format.
