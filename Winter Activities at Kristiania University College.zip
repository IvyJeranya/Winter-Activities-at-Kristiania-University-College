You can download the project as a ZIP file, which includes all the necessary files to run the website locally on your computer. 
The ZIP file contains all the HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, and a folder with images used throughout the site. Once extracted, you will 
have full access to all the resources, including the images that are displayed on the site.

This allows you to explore the structure and design of the website, and you can even customize it for your own use. 
Just unzip the file and open the HTML files in your browser to get started!
